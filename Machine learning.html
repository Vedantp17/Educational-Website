		<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.</p>
	<center><h2><strong>An introduction to Machine Learning</strong></h2></center>
	<p>The term Machine Learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, and stated that “it gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. 
		And in 1997, Tom Mitchell gave a “well-posed” mathematical and relational definition that “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.Machine Learning is the latest buzzword floating around. It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfields of Computer Science. So what does Machine Learning really mean?
		Let’s try to understand Machine Learning in layman’s terms. Consider you are trying to toss a paper into a dustbin. </p>
	<p>
		After the first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force into it. After the second attempt, you realize you are closer to the target but you need to increase your throw angle. What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result. We are programmed to learn from our experience. 
        This implies that the tasks in which machine learning is concerned to offer a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing’s proposal in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, in which the question “Can machines think?” is replaced with the question “Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?” 
        Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to “produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results” and uncover “hidden insights” through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set(input).
	</p>
	<p>Suppose that you decide to check out that offer for a vacation. You browse through the travel agency website and search for a hotel. When you look at a specific hotel, just below the hotel description there is a section titled “You might also like these hotels”. This is a common use case of Machine Learning called “Recommendation Engine”. Again, many data points were used to train a model in order to predict what will be the best hotels to show you under that section, based on a lot of information they already know about you. 

		So if you want your program to predict, for example, traffic patterns at a busy intersection (task T), you can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (experience E) and, if it has successfully “learned”, it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (performance measure P). 
		The highly complex nature of many real-world problems, though, often means that inventing specialized algorithms that will solve them perfectly every time is impractical, if not impossible. Examples of machine learning problems include, “Is this cancer?”, “Which of these people are good friends with each other?”, “Will this person like this movie?” such problems are excellent targets for Machine Learning, and in fact, machine learning has been applied to such problems with great success. 
	</p>
	
		<center><h2><strong> What is Machine Learning ?</strong></h2></center>
	<P>
		Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term “Machine Learning”. He defined machine learning as – “Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
		In a very layman manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.

	<p style="color: black;">
        Example: Training of students during exam.
        While preparing for the exams students don’t actually cram the subject but try to learn it with complete understanding. Before the examination, they feed their machine(brain) with a good amount of high-quality data (questions and answers from different books or teachers notes or online video lectures). Actually, they are training their brain with input as well as output i.e. what kind of approach or logic do they have to solve a different kind of questions. Each time they solve practice test papers and find the performance (accuracy /score) by comparing answers with answer key given, Gradually, the performance keeps on increasing, gaining more confidence with the adopted approach. That’s how actually models are built, train machine with data (both inputs and outputs are given to model) and when the time comes test on data (with input only) and achieves our model scores by comparing its answer with the actual output which has not been fed while training. Researchers are working with assiduous efforts to improve algorithms, techniques so that these models perform even much better
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>What does exactly learning means for a computer?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		A computer is said to be learning from Experiences with respect to some class of Tasks, if its performance in a given Task improves with the Experience.
		A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>How things work in reality:-</strong><br>
		1) In health care, ML is doing a fabulous job. Researchers and scientists have prepared models to train machines for detecting cancer just by looking at slide – cell images. For humans to perform this task it would have taken a lot of time. But now, no more delay, machines predict the chances of having or not having cancer with some accuracy and doctors just have to give an assurance call, that’s it. The answer to – how is this possible is very simple -all that is required, is, high computation machine, a large amount of good quality image data, ML model with good algorithms to achieve state-of-the-art results.
        Doctors are using ML even to diagnose patients based on different parameters under consideration.<br>
		2) You all might have use IMDB ratings, Google Photos where it recognizes faces, Google Lens where the ML image-text recognition model can extract text from the images you feed in, Gmail which categories E-mail as social, promotion, updates or forum using text classification,which is a part of ML.
	</p>

    <center><h2><strong>How does Machine Learning Works?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
        1)<strong>A Decision Process:</strong><br>
		In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.<br>
		2)<strong>An Error Function:</strong><br>
		When an algorithm learns from example data and associated target responses that can consist of numeric values or string labels, such as classes or tags, in order to later predict the correct response when posed with new examples comes under the category of Supervised learning. This approach is indeed similar to human learning under the supervision of a teacher. The teacher provides good examples for the student to memorize, and the student then derives general rules from these specific examples.<br>
		3)<strong>An Model Optimization Process:</strong><br>
		If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.<br>
		4)Gathering past data in any form suitable for processing.The better the quality of data, the more suitable it will be for modeling.<br>
		5)Data Processing – Sometimes, the data collected is in the raw form and it needs to be pre-processed.
		Example: Some tuples may have missing values for certain attributes, an, in this case, it has to be filled with suitable values in order to perform machine learning or any form of data mining.
		Missing values for numerical attributes such as the price of the house may be replaced with the mean value of the attribute whereas missing values for categorical attributes may be replaced with the attribute with the highest mode. This invariably depends on the types of filters we use. If data is in the form of text or images then converting it to numerical form will be required, be it a list or array or matrix. Simply, Data is to be made relevant and consistent. It is to be converted into a format understandable by the machine.<br>
		6)Divide the input data into training,cross-validation and test sets. The ratio between the respective sets must be 6:2:2.<br>
		7)Building models with suitable algorithms and techniques on the training set.<br>
		8)Testing our conceptualized model with data which was not fed to the model at the time of training and evaluating its performance using metrics such as F1 score, precision and recall.
		
	</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Pre-requisites to learn ML:</strong><br>
		1)Linear Algebra.<br>
		2)Statistics and Probability.<br>
		3)Calculus.<br>
        4)Graph theory.<br>
		5)Programming Skills – Language such as Python, R, MATLAB, C++ or Octave.<br>

	<center><h2><strong>Classification of Machine Learning</strong></h2></center>
    <p>
        Machine learning implementations are classified into three major categories, depending on the nature of the learning “signal” or “response” available to a learning system which is as follows:-<br>
		1)<strong>Supervised learning:</strong><br>
		Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and more.<br>
		2)<strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong><br>
		Whereas when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own. This type of algorithm tends to restructure the data into something else, such as new features that may represent a class or a new series of un-correlated values. They are quite useful in providing humans with insights into the meaning of data and new useful inputs to supervised machine learning algorithms. 
        As a kind of learning, it resembles the methods humans use to figure out that certain objects or events are from the same class, such as by observing the degree of similarity between objects. Some recommendation systems that you find on the web in the form of marketing automation are based on this type of learning.<br>
		3)<strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong><br>
		When you present the algorithm with examples that lack labels, as in unsupervised learning. However, you can accompany an example with positive or negative feedback according to the solution the algorithm proposes comes under the category of Reinforcement learning, which is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions (so the product is prescriptive, not just descriptive, as in unsupervised learning), and the decisions bear consequences. In the human world, it is just like learning by trial and error. 
        Errors help you learn because they have a penalty added (cost, loss of time, regret, pain, and so on), teaching you that a certain course of action is less likely to succeed than others. An interesting example of reinforcement learning occurs when computers learn to play video games by themselves.<br>
        4)<strong>Semi-supervised learning:</strong><br>
        where an incomplete training signal is given: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. There is a special case of this principle known as Transduction where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing.

	<center><h2><strong>Application of Machine Learning</strong></h2></center>
    <p>
       <strong>1. Social Media Features</strong><br>
	   Social media platforms use machine learning algorithms and approaches to create some attractive and excellent features. For instance, Facebook notices and records your activities, chats, likes, and comments, and the time you spend on specific kinds of posts. Machine learning learns from your own experience and makes friends and page suggestions for your profile.
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/social_media_features.jpg"></center>
	 <p>
	   <strong>2. Product Recommendations</strong><br>
	   Product recommendation is one of the most popular and known applications of machine learning. Product recommendation is one of the stark features of almost every e-commerce website today, which is an advanced application of machine learning techniques. Using machine learning and AI, websites track your behavior based on your previous purchases, searching patterns, and cart history, and then make product recommendations.
    </p>
	<center><img src="images/product_recommendations.jpg"></center>
	<p><strong>3. Image Recognition</strong><br>
		Image recognition, which is an approach for cataloging and detecting a feature or an object in the digital image, is one of the most significant and notable machine learning and AI techniques. This technique is being adopted for further analysis, such as pattern recognition, face detection, and face recognition.<br>
		<center><img src="images/face-recognition.jpg"></center>
	<p>
		<strong>4. Banking Domain</strong><br>
		Banks are now using the latest advanced technology machine learning has to offer to help prevent fraud and protect accounts from hackers. The algorithms determine what factors to consider to create a filter to keep harm at bay. Various sites that are unauthentic will be automatically filtered out and restricted from initiating transactions.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>5. Regulating Healthcare Efficiency and Medical Services</strong><br>
		Significant healthcare sectors are actively looking at using machine learning algorithms to manage better. They predict the waiting times of patients in the emergency waiting rooms across various departments of hospitals. The models use vital factors that help define the algorithm, details of staff at various times of day, records of patients, and complete logs of department chats and the layout of emergency rooms. Machine learning algorithms also come to play when detecting a disease, therapy planning, and prediction of the disease situation. This is one of the most necessary machine learning applications.
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>Decision Tree</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		<strong>Decision tree:</strong> Decision tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label.<br>
		Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.<br>
        Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.<br>
        We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree. 
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/dcsion.jpg"></center>
	<p>
		-At the beginning, we consider the whole training set as the root.<br>
        -Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.<br>
        -On the basis of attribute values records are distributed recursively.<br>
        -We use statistical methods for ordering attributes as root or the internal node.<br>
	</p>
    <center><img src="images/decisiontree.jpg"></center>
	<p>
		-As you can see from the above image that Decision Tree works on the Sum of Product form which is also known as Disjunctive Normal Form. In the above image, we are predicting the use of computer in the daily life of the people.<br>
        -In Decision Tree the major challenge is to identification of the attribute for the root node in each level. This process is known as attribute selection.
