		</div>
	
	<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</p>
	<center><h2><strong>What is cloud computing?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>In Simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on internet instead of computer’s hard drive or local server. Cloud computing is also referred as Internet based computing.
	Cloud computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.
    Compared to traditional on-premises IT, and depending on the cloud services you select, cloud computing helps do the following:
    </p>
	<p>
        <strong>Lower IT costs:</strong> Cloud lets you offload some or most of the costs and effort of purchasing, installing, configuring, and managing your own on-premises infrastructure. 
	</p>
	
	<p class = "p2">
        <strong>Improve agility and time-to-value:</strong> With cloud, your organization can start using enterprise applications in minutes, instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond to a request, purchase and configure supporting hardware, and install software. Cloud also lets you empower certain users—specifically developers and data scientists—to help themselves to software and support infrastructure.
	</p>
	<P>
        <strong>Scale more easily and cost-effectively: </strong> Cloud provides elasticity—instead of purchasing excess capacity that sits unused during slow periods, you can scale capacity up and down in response to spikes and dips in traffic. You can also take advantage of your cloud provider’s global network to spread your applications closer to users around the world.
	</P>
	<p style="color: black;">
		The term <strong>‘cloud computing’</strong>also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes some form of virtualized IT infrastructure—servers, operating system software, networking, and other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.

    <center><h2><strong>Cloud computing services</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
        <strong>IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) , and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</strong>  are the three most common models of cloud services, and it’s not uncommon for an organization to use all three. However, there is often confusion among the three and what’s included with each:
        Cloud Computing can be defined as the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. Companies offering such kinds of cloud computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage.
	</p>
    <p>
		<strong>Types of Cloud Computing:</strong><br>
		Most cloud computing services fall into three broad categories: 
	</p>
<ul>
    <li>1)Software as a service (Saas)</li>
    <li>2)Platform as a service (PaaS)</li>
    <li>3)Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</li>
	<li>4)Anything as a service (XaaS)</li>
</ul>
    <p>        <strong>1)SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</strong><br>
		SaaS—also known as cloud-based software or cloud applications—is application software that’s hosted in the cloud and that you access and use via a web browser, a dedicated desktop client, or an API that integrates with your desktop or mobile operating system. In most cases, SaaS users pay a monthly or annual subscription fee; some may offer ‘pay-as-you-go’ pricing based on your actual usage.The SaaS applications are sometimes called <strong>Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
		In addition to the cost savings, time-to-value, and scalability benefits of cloud, SaaS offers the following:<br>
        <strong>Automatic upgrades:</strong> With SaaS, you take advantage of new features as soon as the provider adds them, without having to orchestrate an on-premises upgrade.

    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Protection from data loss:</strong> Because your application data is in the cloud, with the application, you don’t lose data if your device crashes or breaks.
	</p>
    <p>
        <strong>SaaS</strong> is the primary delivery model for most commercial software today—there are hundreds of thousands of SaaS solutions available, from the most focused industry and departmental applications, to powerful enterprise software database and AI (artificial intelligence) software.<br>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Advantages of SaaS:-</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>1.Cost-Effective:</strong> Pay only for what you use.</li>
		<li><strong>2.Reduced time:</strong> Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without needing to download and install any software. This reduces the time spent in installation and configuration and can reduce the issues that can get in the way of the software deployment.</li>
		<li><strong>3.Accessibility:</strong> We can Access app data from anywhere.</li>
		<li><strong>4.Automatic updates:</strong> Rather than purchasing new software, customers rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform the updates.</li>
		<li><strong>5.Scalability:</strong> It allows the users to access the services and features on-demand.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>    <strong>2)Platform as a Service(PaaS)</strong><br>
		PaaS is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet. PaaS services are hosted in the cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser. 
		A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. Thus, the development and deployment of the application take place independent of the hardware.
	</p>
	<P>
		PaaS provides software developers with on-demand platform—hardware, complete software stack, infrastructure, and even development tools—for running, developing, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility of maintaining that platform on-premises.
	</P>
	<p><strong>Advantages of PaaS:-</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>1.Simple and convenient for users:</strong> It provides much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.</li>
		<li><strong>2.Cost-Effective:</strong> It charges for the services provided on a per-use basis thus eliminating the expenses one may have for on-premises hardware and software.</li>
		<li><strong>3.Efficiently managing the lifecycle:</strong> It is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.</li>
		<li><strong>4.Automatic updates:</strong> Rather than purchasing new software, customers rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform the updates.</li>
		<li><strong>5.Efficiency:</strong> It allows for higher-level programming with reduced complexity thus, the overall development of the application can be more effective.</li>
	</ul>
	<P>    <strong>3)Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)</strong><br>
	    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support various operations. Typically IaaS is a service where infrastructure is provided as an outsource to enterprises such as networking equipment, devices, database, and web servers.<br>
		It is also known as <strong>Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</strong> IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month. Some providers also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use.<br>
		It simply provides the underlying operating systems, security, networking, and servers for developing such applications, services, and for deploying development tools, databases, etc. 
	</P>
	<p><strong>Advnatages of IaaS:-</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>1.Cost-Effective: </strong> Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost and IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month.</li>
		<li><strong>2.Website hosting:</strong>Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.</li>
		<li><strong>3.Security: </strong>  The IaaS Cloud Provider may provide better security than your existing software.</li>
		<li><strong>4.Maintenance:</strong> There is no need to manage the underlying data center or the introduction of new releases of the development or underlying software. This is all handled by the IaaS Cloud Provider.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>       <strong>4)Anything as a Service</strong><br>
		Most of the cloud service providers nowadays offer anything as a service that is a compilation of all of the above services including some additional services.<br>
		<strong>Advantages of XaaS:</strong> As this is a combined service, so it has all the advantages of every type of cloud service.

    <center><h2><strong>Types of Cloud</strong></h2></center>
    <p>
		<strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is Internet-based computing in which a shared pool of resources is available over broad network access, these resources can be provisioned or released with minimum management efforts and service provider interaction. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Types of Cloud</strong></p>
    <ul>
		<li>1.Public cloud</li>
		<li>2.Private Cloud</li>
		<li>3.Hybrid Cloud</li>
		<li>4.Community Cloud</li>
	</ul>
	<p>  <strong>Public Cloud:</strong><br>
		Public clouds are managed by third parties which provide cloud services over the internet to the public, these services are available as pay-as-you-go billing models.<br>
		They offer solutions for minimizing IT infrastructure costs and become a good option for handling peak loads on the local infrastructure. Public clouds are the go-to option for small enterprises, which are able to start their businesses without large upfront investments by completely relying on public infrastructure for their IT needs. 
		The fundamental characteristics of public clouds are multitenancy. A public cloud is meant to serve multiple users, not a single customer. A user requires a virtual computing environment that is separated, and most likely isolated, from other users. 
	</p>
		<center><img src="images/Public cloud.jpg"></center>
	</div>
    <p>   <strong>Private cloud:</strong><br>
		Private clouds are distributed systems that work on private infrastructure and provide the users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources. Instead of a pay-as-you-go model in private clouds, there could be other schemes that manage the usage of the cloud and proportionally billing of the different departments or sections of an enterprise. 
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/private cloud.jpg"></center>
	<p>   <strong>Hybrid cloud:</strong><br>
		A hybrid cloud is a heterogeneous distributed system formed by combining facilities of public cloud and private cloud. For this reason, they are also called heterogeneous clouds.<br> 
		A major drawback of private deployments is the inability to scale on-demand and efficiently address peak loads. Here public clouds are needed. Hence, a hybrid cloud takes advantage of both public and private clouds. 	
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/Hybrid Cloud.jpg"></center>
	<p>   <strong>Community cloud:</strong><br>
		Community clouds are distributed systems created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of an industry, a community, or a business sector.<br>
		In the community cloud, the infrastructure is shared between organizations that have shared concerns or tasks. The cloud may be managed by an organization or a third party. 
	</p>
	<center><img src="images/community cloud.jpg"></center>
	<center><h2><strong>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		<strong>There are basically 5 essential characteristics of Cloud:-</strong><br>
	    <strong>1.On-demand self-services:</strong><br>
        The Cloud computing services does not require any human administrators, user themselves are able to provision, monitor and manage computing resources as needed.<br>
		<strong>2.Broad network access:</strong><br>
        The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and heterogeneous devices.<br>
        <strong>3.Rapid elasticity:</strong><br>
        The Computing services should have IT resources that are able to scale out and in quickly and on as needed basis. Whenever the user require services it is provided to him and it is scale out as soon as its requirement gets over.<br>
        <strong>4.Resource pooling:</strong><br>
        The IT resource (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) present are shared across multiple applications and occupant in an uncommitted manner. Multiple clients are provided service from a same physical resource.<br>
		<strong>5.Measured service:</strong><br>
		The resource utilization is tracked for each application and occupant, it will provide both the user and the resource provider with an account of what has been used. This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing and effective use of resource.<br>
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>Anatomy of Cloud Computing</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		<strong>1.Provisioning and Configuration Module:</strong><br>
		It is the lowest level of cloud and typically resides on bare hardware (as a firmware) or on the top of the hypervisor layer. Its function is to abstract the underlying hardware and provide a standard mechanism to spawn instance of virtual machine on demand. It also handles the post-configuration of the operating systems and applications residing on the VM<br>
        <strong>2.Monitoring and Optimization:</strong><br>
		This layer handles the monitoring of all services, storage, networking and applications components in cloud. Based on the statistics, it could perform routine functions that optimize the behavior of the infrastructure components and provide relevant data to the cloud administrator to further optimize the configuration for maximum utilization and performance,<br>
        <strong>3.Metering and Chargeback:</strong><br>
        This layer provides functions to measure the usage of resources in cloud. The metering module collects all the utilization data per domain per use. This module gives the cloud administrator enough data to measure ongoing utilization of resources and to create invoices based on the usage on a periodic basis.<br>
        <strong>4.Orchestration:</strong><br>
        Orchestration is a central to cloud operations. Orchestration converts requests from the service management layer and the monitoring, chargeback modules to appropriate action item which are then submitted to provisioning and configuration module for final closure. Orchestration updates the CMDB in the process.<br>
        <strong>5.Configuration Management Database (CMDB):</strong><br>
		It is a central configuration repository wherein all the meta data and configuration of different modules, resources are kept and updated in the real-time basis. The repository can then be accessed using standards protocols like SOAP by third-party software and integration components. All updates in CMDB happen in real time as requests get processed in cloud.<br>
		<strong>6.Cloud Life cycle Management Layer (CLM):</strong><br>
		This layer handles the coordination of all other layers in cloud. All requests internal and external are addressed to the CLM layer first. CLM may internally route requests and actions to other layers for further processing.<br>
		<strong>7.Service Catalog:</strong><br>
        It is central to the definition of cloud, SC defines what kind of services the cloud is capable of providing and at what cost to the end user. SC is the first thing that is drafted before a cloud is architecture. The service management layer consults SC before it processes any request for a new resource.<br>
	</p>
    <center><h2><strong>Economics of Cloud Computing</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		Economics of Cloud Computing is based on the PAY AS YOU GO method. Users/Customers must have to pay only for their way of usage of the cloud services. It definitely beneficial for the users. So that Cloud is economically very convenient for all. Another side is to eliminate some indirect cost which is generated by assets such as license of software and their support. In cloud, users can use software application on subscription basis without any cost because the property of the software providing service remains to the cloud provider.<br>
		<strong>Economical background of cloud is more useful for developers in the following ways:</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>*Pay as you go model offered by cloud providers.</li>
			<li>*Scalable and Simple.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Cloud Computing Allows:</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>*Reduces the capital costs of infrastructure.</li>
			<li>*Removes the maintenance cost.</li>
			<li>*Removes the administrative cost.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>What is Capital Cost ?</strong><br>
		It is cost occurred in the purchasing infrastructure or the assets that is important in the production of goods. It takes long time to generate profit.<br>
        In the case of start-ups, there is no extra budget for the infrastructure and its maintenance. So cloud can minimizes expenses of any small organization in terms of economy. It leads to the developers can only focus on the development logic and not on the maintenance of the infrastructure.<br>
        There are three different Pricing Strategies which are introduced by the Cloud Computing: Tiered Pricing, Per-unit Pricing, and Subscription based Pricing. These are explained as following below.<br>
		<strong>1.Tired Pricing:</strong><br>
		Cloud Services are offered in the various tiers. Each tier offers fix service agreements at specific cost. Amazon EC2 uses this kind of pricing.<br>
        <strong>2.Per-unit Pricing:</strong><br>
        The model is based upon the unit specific service concept. Data transfer and memory allocation includes in this model for specific units. GoGrid uses this kind of pricing in terms of RAM/hour.<br>
        <strong>3.Subscription based Pricing:</strong><br>
		In this model users are paying periodic subscription fee for the usage of software.<br>
