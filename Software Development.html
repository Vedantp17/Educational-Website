	<center><h2><strong>What is software development?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.

    Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. There are three basic types:</p>

	<p>
        <strong>System software</strong> to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
	</p>
	
	<p class = "p2">
        <strong>Programming software</strong> to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.
	</p>
	<P>
        <strong>Application software </strong> (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players and security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.1
	</P>
	<p style="color: black;">
        A possible fourth type is <strong>embedded software</strong>. Embedded systems software is used to control machines and devices not typically considered computers — telecommunications networks, cars, industrial robots and more. These devices, and their software, can be connected as part of the Internet of Things (IoT).2

    Software development is primarily conducted by programmers, software engineers and software developers. These roles interact and overlap, and the dynamics between them vary greatly across development departments and communities
	</p>
	<p>
        <strong>Programmers, or coders,</strong> write source code to program computers for specific tasks like merging databases, processing online orders, routing communications, conducting searches or displaying text and graphics. Programmers typically interpret instructions from software developers and engineers and use programming languages like C++ or Java to carry them out.
	</p>
	<p>
        <strong>Software engineers</strong> apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real world, as with bridges or elevators. Their responsibility has grown as products have become increasingly more intelligent with the addition of microprocessors, sensors and software. Not only are more products relying on software for market differentiation, but their software development must be coordinated with the product’s mechanical and electrical development work.

    <center><h2><strong>Steps in the software development process</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
        Developing software typically involves the following steps:<br>
      
        <strong> Selecting a methodology</strong> to establish a framework in which the steps of software development are applied. It describes an overall work process or roadmap for the project. Methodologies can include Agile development, DevOps, Rapid Application Development (RAD), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Waterfall and others.
	</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Gathering requirements</strong> to understand and document what is required by users and other stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Choosing or building an architecture</strong> as the underlying structure within which the software will operate.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong> Developing a design</strong> around solutions to the problems presented by requirements, often involving process models and storyboards.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Building a model</strong> with a modeling tool that uses a modeling language like SysML or UML to conduct early validation, prototyping and simulation of the design.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Constructing code</strong> in the appropriate programming language. Involves peer and team review to eliminate problems early and produce quality software faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Testing</strong> with pre-planned scenarios as part of software design and coding — and conducting performance testing to simulate load testing on the applicatio.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Managing configuration and defects</strong> to understand all the software artifacts (requirements, design, code, test) and build distinct versions of the software. Establish quality assurance priorities and release criteria to address and track defects.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Deploying</strong> the software for use and responding to and resolving user problems.<br>
        <strong>Migrating data</strong> to the new or updated software from existing applications or data sources if necessary.<br>
        <strong>Managing and measuring the project</strong> to maintain quality and delivery over the application lifecycle, and to evaluate the development process with models such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).
    </p>
    <center><h2><strong>Why is software development important?</strong></h2></center>
    <p>
        Today, it is difficult to imagine a successful business model without online marketing. In the next few years, it will be one of the top ways that determines how well your business grows. Businesses need online platforms and mobile apps because they impact how customers reach you and shop for your products and services.<br>
        Using a well-built platform can result in a huge increase in revenue. Here are some of the most crucial benefits your business can get from proper software development:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.Software development brings your business to new heights of integration. It allows your company to be accessible from almost anywhere via smartphone or computer.</li>
        <li>2.It improves sales and service. The way your customers experience your business is very important. Do you want them to provide you with positive feedback? Then you can’t avoid having an online platform to make it easier for them to reach your services and products.</li>
        <li>3.It helps to implement on-the-go marketing, promoting your products at any place and any time without additional expenses and extra time needed. It doesn’t matter where your customers are. They can access your ads anytime and from anywhere.</li>
        <li>4.It increases customers’ engagement. As with any other business, you probably want to have loyal customers. How should you increase the number of such customers? Work on online marketing strategies. Increase customers’ engagement through the website and application and make them always come back to you, not to your competitor.</li>
        <li>5.Direct communication. Any other strategy can’t bring you an opportunity of direct communication with the customers at the same level as this one does. Direct communication with your customers is the fastest way to boost your brand.
            Software development is much more than just a website or an app. There are many benefits you can get by improving your software.</li>
    </ul>

<center><h2><strong>Key features of effective software development</strong></h2></center>
	<p>Using software development to differentiate brands and gain competitive advantage requires proficiency with the techniques and technologies that can accelerate software deployment, quality and efficacy.</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI):</strong> AI enables software to emulate human decision-making and learning. Neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing and cognitive capabilities present developers and businesses with the opportunity to offer products and services that disrupt marketplaces and leap ahead of the competition. IBM Watson offers developers a way to connect with and use artificial intelligence services as part of their applications through application programming interfaces or APIs. You can also use IBM Watson to improve your product requirements by checking for ambiguity, unclear actors, compound or negative requirements, missing units or tolerances, incomplete requirements, and unspecific quantities.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Cloud-native development:</strong> Cloud-native development is a way of building applications to exploit cloud environments. A cloud-native application consists of discrete, reusable components known as microservices that are designed to integrate into any cloud environment. These microservices act as building blocks and are often packaged in containers. Because of this architecture, cloud-native applications can use cloud environments to improve application performance, flexibility and extensibility.
	</p> 
	<p>
		<strong>Cloud-based development:</strong> Just as IT organizations look to the cloud to improve resource management and cut costs, so do software development organizations. In this way, the cloud can be used as a fast, flexible and cost-efficient integrated development environment (IDE) or development Platform as a Service (PaaS). Cloud-based development environments can support coding, design, integration, testing and other development functions. They can also offer access to APIs, microservices, DevOps and other development tools, services and expertise. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain is a secure, digitally linked ledger that eliminates cost and vulnerability introduced by parties like banks, regulatory bodies and other intermediaries. It is transforming businesses by freeing capital, accelerating processes, lowering transaction costs and more.  Blockchain presents a tremendous opportunity for software development. Developers are working with distributed ledgers and open source Hyperledger (link resides outside of ibm.com) technology to change how businesses operate.
	</p> 
	<p>
		<strong>Analytics:</strong> Annual demand for data scientists, data developers, and data engineers will reach nearly 700,000 openings by 2020. The demand signifies how critical it is for companies to gain insight and value from the explosion of data. Accordingly, software developers are integrating advanced analytics capabilities into their applications. Cloud-based services and APIs make it simpler to guide data exploration, automate predictive analytics and create dashboards that deliver new insights and improve decision making.
    </p>
	<P>
		<strong>Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE):</strong> In MBSE, software modeling languages are used to perform early prototyping, simulation and analysis of software designs for early validation. Building designs in MBSE helps you to analyze and elaborate project requirements and move rapidly from design to implementation.  
	</P>
	<p>
		<strong>Low code:</strong> Forrester defines low code as: “Products and/or cloud services for application development that employ visual, declarative techniques instead of programming and are available to customers at low- or no-cost in money and training ...” 4 In short, it’s a development practice that reduces the need for coding and enables non-coders or citizen developers to build or help build applications quickly and at lower cost.
